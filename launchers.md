# Reminder
You need a executor to execute these scripts. Executor is to be ~~client-sided~~ or server-sided this is not a problem.

**ATTENTION**: If you are using a client-sided executor you can't execute require scripts! (also all scripts is not mine.)

**HINT**: if scripts have "FE", that script can be seen by everyone (even client-sided)
